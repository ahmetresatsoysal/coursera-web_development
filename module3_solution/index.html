				<p>Fenerbahçe S.K. (Turkish: Fenerbahçe Spor Kulübü, 'Fenerbahçe Sports Club'), commonly known as Fenerbahçe (/fəˈnɛərbɑːtʃeɪ/,[citation needed] Turkish: [feˈnæɾbahtʃe]), is a Turkish sports club based in Istanbul, Turkey. The club's name translates as "Lighthouse in the Garden" and comes from the Fenerbahçe neighbourhood of the Kadıköy district in Istanbul. It is a major multi-sport club that competes in football, basketball, volleyball, athletics, swimming, sailing, rowing, boxing, and table tennis, among many others, with many major honours won in each department, but the professional football and basketball departments are the most notable. Fenerbahçe, often known informally as Fener, are one of the most successful and best supported football teams in Turkey, having never been relegated to lower divisions, and currently compete in the Turkish Super League and the Turkish Cup. They are nicknamed Sarı Kanaryalar (Turkish for "Yellow Canaries") and play their home games at Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium, their own traditional home ground in Kadıköy, Istanbul.

					Fenerbahçe has won 19 Turkish Super League titles, 6 Turkish Cups and 9 Turkish Super Cups, among others.[2] With 28 Turkish championships in total (19 Super League, 6 National Division, and 3 former Turkish Football Championship titles) Fenerbahçe holds the record for most national championship titles won.[3][4][5] The club also leads the all-time table of the Turkish Super League. In international club football, Fenerbahçe has won the Balkans Cup in 1968, which is marked as the first ever non-domestic trophy won by a Turkish football club. In UEFA competitions, Fenerbahçe has reached the quarter-finals in the 1963–64 season of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and in the 2007–08 season of the UEFA Champions League. The club's semi-final performance in the 2012–13 season of the UEFA Europa League is marked as its greatest achievement in European competitions. Fenerbahçe is a member of the European Club Association.

				Fenerbahçe is one of the best supported Turkish sports club with millions of fans in Turkey as well as millions of others in the Turkish communities all over the world. The club has a long-standing rivalry with other major Istanbul clubs, namely with Beşiktaş and Galatasaray. The Intercontinental Derby between Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray is considered to be one of the fiercest and most intense derbies in the world.[6][7] Its name derives from the fact that the clubs are located on the Asian (Fenerbahçe) and European (Galatasaray) sides of the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul. </p>
